<div>
This column allows you to more flexibly configure what types of statuses to show.  Options include
<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li><b>Only show the last status</b> - Choose this if all you ever want to show is the status of the last build.</li>
<li><b>Builds to show</b> - For example, if you want to show multiple statuses, but once a build is a month old, you want to stop showing it.  Choose "0" to show all statuses.</li>
<li><b>Time display options</b>
<ul>
	<li><b>Days/hours ago</b> - for example "12 days" or "2 hours"</li>
	<li><b>Date/Time - Prefer Date</b> - will show the date (e.g. "5/25/2016") most of the time, but will show the time if the build was today.</li>
	<li><b>Date/Time - Prefer Date/Time</b> - the same as the previous option, except when there is only one status in the column, the date/time is shown.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Colorblind options</b> - Color-coding can cause accessibility concerns.  Choose a colorblind hints option if this will be useful to you.</li>
</ul>
