<p>Multi-Configuration projects always run one <i>parent build</i> job.
The <i>parent build</i> verifies source control checkout operations,
then monitors the execution of child jobs created to satisfy the
<b>Configuration Matrix</b>.

</p><p>

Sometimes the <i>parent build</i> must run on some computers, but not
others. This may be due to constraints such as a lack of source control or
other software on a computer, file permission issues, etc.

</p><p>

Restrict where the <i>parent build</i> runs by selecting a specific
computer's node name.  Or, use a label to restrict the <i>parent
build</i> to run only on computers marked with that label.</p>
