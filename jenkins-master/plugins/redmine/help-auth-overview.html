  <p>Redmine User Auth module connects to Redmine database to authenticate users.</p>
  <p>Password entered during Jenkins login is hashed, and compared with hash stored in database in "passField".<br>
  Hash algorithm depends on Redmine version:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>in Redmine 1.2.0 and above, the algorithm is: SHA1(salt + SHA1(clear_text_passwd))</li>
    <li>in Redmine 1.1.x and lower, there is no salt, so the algorithm is: SHA1(clear_text_passwd)</li>
  </ol></p>
