 If you check this option, Hudson will keep doxygen HTML result for each successful build. 
 This allows you to browse doxygen results for older builds, at the expense of additional disk space requirement.

 Unchecked, Hudson will only keep the latest doxygen HTML, so older doxygen HTML will be overwritten as new builds succeed.
