	Hudson understands the Seleniumhq test report HTML format. When this option is configured, Hudson can provide useful information about test results, such as historical test result trends, a web UI for viewing test reports, tracking failures, and so on.<br/>
	<br/>  
	To use this feature, first set up your build to run tests, then specify the path to Selenium HTML files in the Ant glob syntax, such as **/build/test-reports/*.xml. Be sure not to include any non-report files into this pattern.
